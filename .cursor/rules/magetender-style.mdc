# Magetender Style Guide

## Comments
- Do not comment when the variable/name explains intent. Only comment at the start of complicated functions or complicated loops.
- Only useful comments that help reading. Less is more.

## Indentation & Spacing
- **Indentation:** Tabs only, one tab per scope (including class methods).
- **Spacing:** Spaces for readability: `if (x == y)` not `if (x==y)`. Blank lines between major sections (e.g. fields vs methods).

## Naming
- **Case:** camelCase for variables, PascalCase for class names. Minor scope variables can be lower-case (e.g. `bool last = …`).
- **Functions:** Name must clearly describe the single task. Split into separate functions if multiple significant tasks.

## Braces (Allman style)
- Class and function braces on their own lines:
```csharp
void FunctionName(int parameter)
{
}
```

## Formulas
- Use parentheses to make order of operations obvious. Spaces around operators: `a + b`, `x * 0.5f`.
- Short names like `i`, `j`, `t` are OK inside loops or simple math only; not for general gameplay values.

## Readability
- **Line length:** Target 80–120 characters; break longer lines.
- Put related methods next to each other.
- Short comments only when intent is not obvious. No joke names or unclear shortcuts.

## Language & Unity
- Code must compile and run under **Unity 6000.0.50f1**. Follow standard C# and Unity conventions. No experimental or preview C#. Compile with no warnings or errors before commit.

## Asset Naming
- **Sprites:** PNG. Variants: name describes character and state (e.g. `dracula_angry.png`). Location: respective `Art` subfolder (Objects, Ingredients, Monsters).
- **Other assets:** Backgrounds, props, etc.: PNG under `Art` in the correct subfolder (e.g. Background).
